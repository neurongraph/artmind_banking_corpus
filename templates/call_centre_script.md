## Purpose

Provide standardized call centre scripts for common customer scenarios to ensure consistent, professional service and proper product knowledge across all team members.

---

## Opening Script (All Calls)

```
[Phone rings]

Agent: "Good morning/afternoon. You've reached FirstUK Bank. 
May I have your name, please?"

[Customer provides name]

Agent: "Thank you, [Customer Name]. How can I help you today?"

[Customer explains reason for call]

Agent: "I'd be happy to help with that. For security, may I 
have the last 4 digits of your account number and your date 
of birth?"

[Verify against system]

Agent: "Thank you. I've confirmed your details. Let me help 
you with [reason]."
```

---

## SCENARIO 1: Account Opening Inquiry

**Customer:** "I'd like to open a SmartSaver account."

**Agent Script:**

```
Agent: "Excellent choice! Our SmartSaver account offers 
some of the best interest rates available. We currently offer 
4.50% to 4.80% AER depending on your balance, with no monthly 
fees.

We have three ways to open an account:

1. Online at www.firstuk.bank/open-account (1-2 business 
   days)
2. In one of our 12 branches (same day or next day)
3. By post (5-7 business days)

Which option works best for you?"

[If online:]
"Online is fastest. You'll need a UK Passport or Driving 
License, plus proof of address (utility bill, council tax, or 
bank statement). The process takes about 10 minutes."

[If branch:]
"You can visit any of our 12 locations. Our staff will help 
you open the account on the spot. Do you have a branch near 
you?"

[If postal:]
"I'll send you our application pack. You'll fill it out and 
post it back within 5-7 days."

Do you have any questions about the SmartSaver?"
```

---

## SCENARIO 2: Interest Rate Question

**Customer:** "Why did my interest rate drop?"

**Agent Script:**

```
Agent: "Great question. Our SmartSaver rates are variable, 
which means they move with the Bank of England's base rate. 
The Bank of England recently changed their rate, and we pass 
that change to customers.

We maintain a fixed 2.5% margin above the BoE rate, so your 
rate always stays competitive.

Your current rate is 4.50% AER. If you'd like, I can show 
you how that's calculated and when your next interest payment 
is due.

Would you like to know anything else about your rate?"
```

---

## SCENARIO 3: Failed Transaction

**Customer:** "My transfer didn't go through."

**Agent Script:**

```
Agent: "I'm sorry to hear that. Let me look into this for you.

Could you tell me:
- When did you attempt the transfer?
- How much was it for?
- To which account?

[Customer provides details]

Let me check your account... [Pull transaction record]

I can see what happened. The transfer failed because [reason: 
insufficient funds/invalid recipient/account closed/other].

Here's what we can do:
[Offer resolution based on scenario]

Would this work for you?"

[If insufficient funds:]
"Once you have enough balance, we can resubmit the transfer 
immediately."

[If invalid recipient:]
"Can you double-check the account number? If you'd like, I 
can help you get it right and resubmit."

[If account closed:]
"It looks like the recipient's account is closed. Do you have 
an alternative account for them?"
```

---

## SCENARIO 4: Fraud/Unauthorized Transaction

**Customer:** "I see a transaction I didn't authorize."

**Agent Script:**

```
Agent: "I'm very sorry to hear that. We take fraud seriously 
and will investigate immediately.

Can you tell me:
- Which transaction is unauthorized?
- When did it occur?
- How much was it for?

[Customer provides details]

I'm going to:
1. Block any suspicious transactions right away
2. Investigate what happened
3. Refund you within 10 days if the transaction is confirmed 
   as unauthorized

In the meantime, we recommend:
- Monitor your account for any other unusual activity
- Change your online banking password
- Don't share your PIN with anyone

We'll follow up with you within 5 business days with our 
findings. Is there a phone number where we can reach you?"
```

---

## SCENARIO 5: Complaint

**Customer:** "I want to file a complaint."

**Agent Script:**

```
Agent: "I'm sorry you've had a poor experience. We want to 
make this right. Let me document your complaint.

Can you tell me:
- What happened?
- When did it occur?
- How would you like us to resolve it?

[Customer explains]

I'm escalating this to our Complaints Team. Here's what 
happens next:

1. We'll investigate within 8 calendar days
2. You'll receive a response by email with our findings
3. If you disagree, you can escalate to the Financial 
   Ombudsman Service (free and independent)

Your complaint reference number is [EXC-XXXXX]. Please keep 
this for your records.

We'll be in touch within 8 days. Is there anything else I can 
help with today?"
```

---

## SCENARIO 6: Standing Order Setup

**Customer:** "I'd like to set up a standing order."

**Agent Script:**

```
Agent: "Perfect! A standing order lets you set up recurring 
payments to anyone. Let me collect the details:

1. Who do you want to pay? (Recipient name)
2. Their bank details? (Account number and sort code)
3. How much each time?
4. How often? (Weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually)
5. What date should it start?

[Customer provides details]

Let me confirm:
- Paying [Recipient] £[amount]
- Every [frequency]
- Starting [date]

Is that correct?

[Confirm]

Great! I've set this up. The first payment will go on [date], 
and then every [frequency] after that. You can change or 
cancel anytime by calling us.

Anything else I can help with?"
```

---

## SCENARIO 7: Account Closure

**Customer:** "I'd like to close my account."

**Agent Script:**

```
Agent: "I'm sorry to hear you want to close your account. 
Before you go, may I ask why? This helps us improve.

[Customer explains]

I understand. Let me explain the closure process:

1. We'll calculate your final balance (including pending 
   interest)
2. Cancel any standing orders or Direct Debits
3. Transfer any remaining funds to your new bank
4. Your account will be closed

The process takes 5-7 business days. How would you like to 
receive your final balance?
- Transfer to another UK bank account (1-2 days)
- Cheque in the post (3-5 days)
- Cash in a branch (same day)

[Customer chooses option]

Before I process this, are you sure you want to close? We'd 
love to keep you as a customer. Is there anything we could 
improve?"

[If customer still wants to close:]
"I've processed your closure request. Your account will close 
in 5-7 days. We appreciate your business."
```

---

## SCENARIO 8: Direct Debit Question

**Customer:** "Why was I charged by Direct Debit?"

**Agent Script:**

```
Agent: "Let me look that up for you. A Direct Debit is when 
a company (like a utility or insurance) automatically deducts 
payment from your account.

Can you tell me:
- Which company charged you?
- When was the charge?
- How much was it?

[Customer provides details]

I found it. This is for [Company Name], your [utility/subscription]. 
You authorized this Direct Debit when you signed up.

If you didn't authorize it or want to cancel, I can help:

Option 1: Cancel the Direct Debit with us (immediate)
Option 2: Contact [Company] directly to cancel

Either way, if you were charged without authorization, we'll 
refund you within 10 days.

Would you like to cancel this Direct Debit?"
```

---

## SCENARIO 9: Card Replacement

**Customer:** "My card is lost/damaged."

**Agent Script:**

```
Agent: "Don't worry, we can replace that right away.

First, I'm going to block your card immediately so no one 
else can use it.

[Block card in system]

Now, for the replacement:

We can send a new card in 3-5 business days (free), or an 
expedited replacement overnight for £25.

Which would you prefer?

In the meantime:
- Your card is blocked and can't be used
- Existing Direct Debits and standing orders still work
- You can use online banking and mobile app
- Visit a branch to withdraw cash if needed

Any other questions?"
```

---

## SCENARIO 10: Password Reset

**Customer:** "I can't log into online banking."

**Agent Script:**

```
Agent: "No problem, let me help you regain access.

For security, I'll verify your identity first:
- Last 4 digits of account number: [verify]
- Date of birth: [verify]
- Mother's maiden name: [verify]

[Verify details]

Great. Now I'm sending a password reset link to your 
registered email address. Check your email (might take a few 
minutes), click the link, and create a new password.

If you don't see the email:
1. Check your spam folder
2. Wait a few minutes and try again
3. Call us back if you don't receive it

Make sure your new password is strong (mix of letters, 
numbers, symbols).

Let me know if that works!"
```

---

## Closing Script (All Calls)

```
Agent: "Is there anything else I can help you with today?"

[If no:]
"Thank you for choosing FirstUK Bank. Have a great day!"

[If yes:]
"Happy to help. What else can I do for you?"

[After final resolution:]
"Thank you for calling FirstUK Bank. Your case reference is 
[number]. We appreciate your business!"

[End call]
```
