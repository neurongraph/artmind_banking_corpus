## Executive Summary

FirstUK Bank maintains a Fraud Prevention Policy to detect, prevent, and respond to fraudulent transactions and account takeover. The policy establishes procedures for fraud detection, customer reimbursement, and investigation.

---

## Purpose & Scope

### Purpose

To establish fraud prevention procedures that:
- Detect unauthorized transactions (fraud)
- Block fraudulent activity before settlement
- Reimburse customers fairly for fraud losses
- Investigate fraud cases
- Prevent repeat fraud by same perpetrator

### Scope

Applies to:
- All customer accounts (savings, current, mortgages)
- All transaction types (deposits, withdrawals, transfers, card payments)
- All fraud scenarios (card fraud, account takeover, check fraud, etc.)
- All channels (branch, online, mobile, phone, ATM)

---

## Policy Statement

**FirstUK Bank protects customers from fraud through detection systems, real-time transaction monitoring, and fair liability allocation.**

---

## Fraud Categories

### 1. Authorized Fraud (Customer Liability)

**Scenario:** Customer authorizes transaction but later claims fraud

**Characteristics:**
- Customer knew of transaction
- Customer provided details to criminal
- Customer lacks authorization
- Negligence by customer

**Examples:**
- Customer calls "bank" (actually criminal) and authorizes transfer
- Customer gives card details to stranger claiming to be support
- Customer wire transfers to criminal "investment opportunity"

**Customer Liability:**
- Customer liable for loss IF customer negligent
- Exception: Fraud by staff member or unauthorized card use

---

### 2. Unauthorized Fraud (Bank Liable)

**Scenario:** Criminal uses account without customer authorization

**Characteristics:**
- Customer did not authorize transaction
- Criminal obtained access (stolen password, card, etc.)
- Customer's liability: £0 (if reported within 24 hours)

**Examples:**
- Card stolen, used by criminal
- Password compromised, unauthorized online transfer
- Account takeover via phishing
- Card cloning at ATM

**Bank Liability:**
- FirstUK Bank reimburses 100% of unauthorized loss
- Reimbursement within 10 business days
- No customer liability (unless gross negligence)

---

### 3. Card Fraud

**Card Not Present (CNP) Fraud:**
- Online purchase, card details stolen
- E.g., website hacking, data breach
- Bank liability depends on authentication strength

**Card Present Fraud:**
- Physical card used by thief
- E.g., card stolen from customer
- Bank liable (unless customer negligent)

**Card Cloning:**
- Card details copied from legitimate card
- Counterfeit card created
- Bank liable for losses post-report

---

### 4. Account Takeover

**Definition:** Criminal gains access to legitimate account (password, security questions)

**Attack Vectors:**
- Phishing email (fake login page)
- Password breach (from third-party data breach)
- Social engineering (customer support impersonation)
- SIM swap (attacker intercepts SMS 2FA)
- Malware on customer's device

**Bank Actions:**
