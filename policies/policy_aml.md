## Transaction Monitoring

### Purpose

Detect suspicious transaction patterns indicative of money laundering or terrorist financing.

### Monitoring Methods

**Automated Rules (Fraud Detection Engine, see [[systems]]):**

| Rule | Threshold | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Large deposit | >£50,000 in 24h | Alert + manual review |
| Rapid movement | Deposit then withdrawal <2h | Alert for review |
| Multiple small transfers | 10+ transfers to different recipients <24h | Velocity alert |
| Geographic anomaly | Transaction in different country within 2 hours | Alert for review |
| High-risk jurisdiction | Transaction with sanctioned country | Auto-block |
| Unusual beneficiary | Transfer to new beneficiary >threshold | Alert for review |

**Manual Monitoring:**
- Financial Crime team reviews alerts
- Pattern analysis for suspicious sequences
- Behavioral profiling changes
- Judgment-based assessment

### Transaction Profile Assessment

**Customer Risk Profile = Transaction Pattern Analysis**

**Normal Profile Examples:**
- Salary deposits monthly + regular bills
- Periodic savings deposits + interest credits
- Business deposits + operational expenses
- Pension payments + utility bills

**Suspicious Pattern Examples:**
- Large deposit immediately followed by international transfer
- Round-dollar amounts to multiple countries
- Cash deposits followed by wire transfers out
- Deposits using different names/accounts
- Structuring (repeated transfers just below reporting threshold)

### Action on Suspicious Transaction

**Step 1: Initial Alert**
- System generates alert or staff observation
- Transaction placed on hold (up to 5 business days)
- Financial Crime team reviews immediately

**Step 2: Investigation**
- Customer contacted for explanation (if safe to do so)
- Supporting documentation reviewed
- Transaction history analyzed
- Risk assessment updated

**Step 3: Decision**
- **Proceed:** Suspicious activity reported, transaction approved
- **Reject:** Decline transaction (without informing customer of AML reason)
- **Block:** Account frozen pending investigation
- **SAR File:** Suspicious Activity Report filed with NCA

**Step 4: Documentation**
- All decisions documented with reasoning
- File marked confidential
- No customer disclosure (tipping off prohibited)

---

## Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR)

### When to File a SAR

**Mandatory SAR Filing Triggers:**
- Money laundering suspected (any amount)
- Terrorist financing suspected
- Proceeds of crime (POCA) suspected
- Sanctions violation
- Large cash transactions with no obvious purpose
- Customers unwilling to provide information
- Structuring detected (deliberately avoiding reporting thresholds)

**Discretionary SAR:**
- Unusual transaction patterns not clearly illegal
- Potential fraud (separate from AML fraud)
- Regulatory concern

### SAR Filing Process

**Step 1: Report Preparation**
- Detailed narrative of suspicious activity
- Timeline of transactions
- Customer and transaction details
- Supporting evidence
- Risk assessment
- Recommendation (ML suspected, TF suspected, or other)

**Step 2: Internal Approval**
- Compliance Head review and approval
- Chief Risk Officer sign-off (if significant)
- CEO notification (if high-profile)

**Step 3: NCA Submission**
- Filed via Suspicious Activity Report Online (SARs Online)
- Filed within 30 days of suspicion arising
- Submission confirmed by NCA

**Step 4: Follow-Up**
- NCA may request additional information
- Bank cooperates fully with any investigation
- Document retention (5 years minimum)

### SAR Confidentiality (Tipping Off)

**Critical:** Do not inform customer of SAR filing.

**Tipping Off Prohibition:**
- Cannot tell customer a SAR has been filed
- Cannot disclose grounds for suspicion
- Cannot describe specific suspicious transactions
- Cannot delay transaction to prepare SAR and then inform customer

**Exception:** SAR already filed and transaction proceeding normally (communication not tipping off)

**Breach Consequences:**
- Criminal offense (up to 2 years imprisonment)
- Regulatory fine
- Disciplinary action (termination)

### Sanctions Screening

**Screening Requirement:**

- Real-time updates (lists change daily)

**Hit Processing:**
