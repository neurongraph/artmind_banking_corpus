## Executive Summary

FirstUK Bank maintains an Information Security Policy to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of customer data, systems, and intellectual property against threats (cyberattacks, unauthorized access, data breaches).

---

## Purpose & Scope

### Purpose

To establish security procedures that:
- Prevent unauthorized access to systems/data
- Protect customer data against breaches
- Ensure system availability and reliability
- Respond rapidly to security incidents
- Meet regulatory security standards (PRA Operational Resilience, FCA)

### Scope

Applies to:
- All customer data (personal, financial)
- All systems and infrastructure
- All staff, contractors, third parties
- All physical and digital assets
- All geographic locations

---

## Policy Statement

**FirstUK Bank protects customer data and systems through defense-in-depth security controls, incident response, and continuous threat monitoring.**

---

## Security Principles

**Zero-Trust Security:**
- No implicit trust (users, devices, networks)
- Continuous authentication and authorization
- Verify every access request
- Assume breach and defend proactively

**Defense-in-Depth:**
- Multiple layers of security controls
- No single point of failure
- Layered protections (network, system, data, process)

**Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability (CIA Triad):**
- **Confidentiality:** Data encrypted, access controlled
- **Integrity:** Data cannot be modified without authorization
- **Availability:** Systems accessible when needed

---

## Threat Landscape

**Known Threats FirstUK Bank Monitors:**

- **Cyberattacks:** Ransomware, malware, phishing
- **Unauthorized Access:** Hacking, credential theft, social engineering
- **Data Breaches:** Sensitive data theft, exposure
- **Insider Threats:** Disgruntled staff, inadvertent disclosure
- **Third-Party Risk:** Vendor compromise, supply chain attacks
- **Natural Disasters:** Power outages, fire, flooding

---

## Access Control

### Authentication (Who You Are)

**Customer Authentication:**
- Online Banking: Username/password + OTP (email/SMS)
- Mobile App: Biometric (fingerprint/face) + optional PIN
- Branch: Photo ID verification

**Staff Authentication:**
- LDAP/Active Directory (username/password)
- MFA for privileged access (admin, compliance)
- Physical badges for facility access
- VPN required for remote access

### Authorization (What You Can Access)

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
- Customer-facing staff: Limited customer data (own customers)
- Compliance staff: Full data access + audit logging
- Technology staff: System access with audit trail
- Executives: Aggregated reports only
- Developers: Pre-production environments only

**Segregation of Duties:**
- Account opening != Account approval
- Transaction initiation != Transaction approval
- System administration != Application development
- Audit != Tested system ownership

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- All access logged (who, what, when, where)
- Audit logs retained 1 year
- Suspicious access patterns flagged
- Periodic access reviews (quarterly)

---

## Data Encryption

### In Transit

**TLS 1.3 (Transport Layer Security):**
- All internet-facing connections encrypted
- HTTPS enforced (HTTP redirects to HTTPS)
- mTLS for internal service-to-service communication
- Certificate management (auto-renewal, monitoring)

**VPN for Remote Access:**
- Staff working remotely use VPN
- All traffic encrypted through secure tunnel
- Multi-factor authentication required

### At Rest

**Database Encryption:**
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive columns
- Encryption keys stored separately (HSM)
- Transparent encryption (application-level)

**Backup Encryption:**
- Encrypted backups to S3
- AES-256 encryption standard
- Keys managed in AWS KMS
- Tested recovery procedures

**File Encryption:**
- Encrypted file storage (on-premises + cloud)
- Encrypted USB/portable devices
- Deletion: Secure overwriting (DoD standard)

---

## Network Security

### Perimeter Security

**Firewall:**
- Stateful inspection firewall
- Ingress: Port 443 (HTTPS) only for public APIs
- Egress: Restricted outbound (whitelist-based)
- Rules logged and monitored

**DDoS Protection:**

- Rate limiting on APIs
- Anomalous traffic detection
- Traffic rerouting if DDoS detected

**Intrusion Detection/Prevention:**
- Network-based IDS (Snort-like rules)
- Host-based IDS on critical systems
- Automated response (block malicious IPs)

### Internal Network Segmentation

**Network Segregation:**
- Customer-facing systems: Separate subnet
- Internal staff systems: Separate subnet
- Database tier: Isolated, restricted access
- Development systems: Separated from production

**VPN & Bastion Hosts:**
- Remote access through VPN only
- Bastion host for admin access
- Multi-hop authentication
- Session logging and timeout

---

## Endpoint Security

### Laptops & Desktops

**Antivirus/Anti-malware:**

- Real-time scanning enabled
- Virus definitions updated daily
- Suspicious behavior isolated automatically

**Device Management:**

- Encryption enforced on all devices
- Lost device remote wipe capability
- OS patches applied within 30 days (critical within 7)

**Full-Disk Encryption:**
- BitLocker (Windows), FileVault (Mac)
- Encryption keys escrowed (recovery)
- Mandatory for all devices with customer data access

---

## Application Security
