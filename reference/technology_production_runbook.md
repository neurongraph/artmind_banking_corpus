  - AMS status: Should be "Green"
  - IBP status: Should be "Green"
  - MBA status: Should be "Green"
  - PPS status: Should be "Green"

- [ ] **Review Alerts Overnight** — Check alert queue for any issues reported 00:00–07:00
  - Command: `kubectl get events -n production | grep -i warning`
  - Action: Address any critical alerts immediately

- [ ] **Verify Database Backups** — Check last backup completed
  - Command: `aws s3 ls s3://firstuk-backups/ --recursive | tail -5`
  - Expected: Most recent backup within last 24 hours

- [ ] **Check Payment Systems** — Verify BACS/FPS connections active
  - Command: `curl https://api.firstuk.bank/health | grep "payments"`
  - Expected: "status": "ok"

**Issue Found?** → Go to Step 6 (Incident Response)

### During Business Hours (09:00–17:00)

**Hourly Checks (5 minutes each):**

- [ ] **API Gateway Health** — Monitor Kong gateway
  - Command: `kong health --yaml | grep status`
  - Expected: All services responding <100ms

- [ ] **Database Connection Pool** — Check PostgreSQL connections
  - Command: `psql -U postgres -c "SELECT datname, count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity GROUP BY datname;"`
  - Expected: <80% of max connections (200/250)

- [ ] **Transaction Processing Rate** — Monitor throughput
  - Command: `tail -f /var/log/pps/transactions.log | grep -c "SUCCESS" | head -1`
  - Expected: 2–5 transactions/minute during business hours

**Issue Found?** → Go to Step 6 (Incident Response)

### End of Business (17:00 PM)

**Checklist (10 minutes):**

- [ ] **Payment Settlement Confirmation** — Verify daily settlement completed
  - Expected: All FPS/BACS payments settled by 17:30

- [ ] **Reconciliation Report** — Run nightly reconciliation
  - Command: `python /scripts/reconciliation.py`
  - Expected: "PASS: All transactions reconciled"

- [ ] **Backup Initiation** — Trigger nightly backup
  - Command: `aws s3 sync /data/backups s3://firstuk-backups/ --sse AES256`
  - Expected: "Backup complete: XXX MB uploaded"

- [ ] **Data Warehouse Load** — Trigger nightly DW load
  - Command: `spark-submit /scripts/dw_load.py`
  - Expected: "Load complete: NNN rows inserted"

## 2. SYSTEM STARTUP (Emergency Only)

**When to Use:** After complete outage or scheduled maintenance restart

### Startup Sequence (Follow Exactly)

**Phase 1: Database (5–10 minutes)**

```
1. Start PostgreSQL
   systemctl start postgresql@main

2. Wait for startup
   psql -U postgres -c "SELECT version();"
   (Should return version info)

3. Verify replication
   psql -U postgres -c "SELECT slot_name, restart_lsn FROM pg_replication_slots;"
   (Should show active slots)

4. Verify backups
   du -h /var/lib/postgresql/backup/
```

**Phase 2: Core Applications (10–15 minutes)**

```
1. Start AMS (Account Management)
   kubectl apply -f /deployments/ams-deployment.yaml
   kubectl rollout status deployment/ams --timeout=5m

2. Start PPS (Payment Processing)
   kubectl apply -f /deployments/pps-deployment.yaml
   kubectl rollout status deployment/pps --timeout=5m

3. Start FDE (Fraud Detection)
   kubectl apply -f /deployments/fde-deployment.yaml
   kubectl rollout status deployment/fde --timeout=5m

4. Verify core services healthy
   kubectl get pods -n production | grep Running
   (Should see all pods in "Running" state)
```

**Phase 3: Customer-Facing (5–10 minutes)**

```
1. Start IBP (Internet Banking)
   kubectl apply -f /deployments/ibp-deployment.yaml
   kubectl rollout status deployment/ibp --timeout=5m

2. Start MBA (Mobile App backend)
   kubectl apply -f /deployments/mba-deployment.yaml
   kubectl rollout status deployment/mba --timeout=5m

3. Clear cache
   redis-cli FLUSHALL

4. Test endpoints
   curl https://api.firstuk.bank/health
   (Should return "status": "ok")
```

**Phase 4: Verification (5 minutes)**

```
1. Run smoke tests
   bash /tests/smoke_tests.sh
   Expected: All tests PASS

2. Verify dashboard
   Check https://dashboard.firstuk.bank
   Expected: All systems Green

3. Notify team
   Post to #operations-channel: "Systems startup complete"
```

**If Any Phase Fails:** Go to Step 6 (Incident Response) — Do NOT proceed to next phase

---

## 3. SYSTEM SHUTDOWN (Maintenance Only)

**When to Use:** Scheduled maintenance, controlled shutdown

### Shutdown Sequence

**Phase 1: Notify Customers**

```
1. Post maintenance notice
   - Website banner: "System maintenance 02:00–03:00 AM"
   - SMS alert to all customers (optional)
   - Check: Maintenance window during low-traffic time
```

**Phase 2: Graceful Shutdown (20 minutes)**

```
1. Stop accepting new transactions
   kubectl scale deployment ibp --replicas=0
   kubectl scale deployment mba --replicas=0

2. Wait for in-flight transactions to complete
   kubectl logs -f deployment/pps | grep "COMPLETE"
   (Monitor for ~10 minutes)

3. Stop payment processing
   kubectl scale deployment pps --replicas=0

4. Stop application servers
   kubectl scale deployment ams --replicas=0
   kubectl scale deployment fde --replicas=0

5. Backup database
   /scripts/backup_database.sh

6. Stop database
   systemctl stop postgresql@main
```

**Phase 3: Notify Completion**

```
Post to #operations: "System shutdown complete"
```

---

## 4. COMMON ISSUES & TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "AMS Service Unavailable"

**Symptoms:** API returns 503, IBP shows error

**Steps:**
```
1. Check service status
   kubectl get pod -n production | grep ams

2. Check logs
   kubectl logs -f deployment/ams | tail -50

3. Check database connection
   curl https://api.firstuk.bank/ams/health/db

4. If DB connection issue
   Verify PostgreSQL running: systemctl status postgresql@main
   Verify connection pool: psql -U postgres -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname='firstuk_prod';"

5. Restart service
   kubectl rollout restart deployment/ams
   kubectl rollout status deployment/ams --timeout=5m

6. Verify recovery
   curl https://api.firstuk.bank/accounts -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]"
   (Should return account list)
```

### Issue: "Payment Processing Slow"

**Symptoms:** FPS transfers taking >15 minutes, BACS delayed

**Steps:**
```
1. Check payment queue
   curl https://api.firstuk.bank/pps/queue-length

2. If queue growing
   Monitor: kubectl logs -f deployment/pps | grep "pending"

3. Check if database is bottleneck
   psql -U postgres -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE wait_event_type='IO';"

4. If high I/O wait
   Increase database resources: kubectl set resources deployment/ams --limits=memory=4Gi,cpu=2

5. Monitor recovery
   Watch queue decrease: watch 'curl https://api.firstuk.bank/pps/queue-length'

6. If not improving
   Escalate to database team (see Step 6)
```

### Issue: "High Fraud Alert Rate"

**Symptoms:** Many legitimate transactions flagged as fraud, customer complaints

**Steps:**
```
1. Check FDE alert rate
   kubectl logs -f deployment/fde | grep "ALERT" | wc -l
   (Compare to baseline: <10 alerts/hour)

2. Review recent alerts
   tail -100 /var/log/fde/alerts.log | grep -A5 "false_positive"

3. If alert rate >3x normal
   Check for DDoS/attack: kubectl get events -n production

4. Temporarily loosen rules
   Edit /config/fraud_rules.yaml, restart FDE
   Notify Financial Crime team

5. Review with team
   Schedule urgent meeting to review false positives

6. Restore to normal settings
   Once resolved, revert rule changes
```
