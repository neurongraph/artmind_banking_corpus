## Incident Response Team

### Composition

- Primary: Chief Information Security Officer
- Backup: Chief Technology Officer

**Response Team Members:**
- Technology Lead (system expertise)
- Security Lead (investigation)
- Communications Lead (internal/external messaging)
- Operations Lead (restoration)
- Compliance/Legal (regulatory obligations)

### On-Call Rotation

- **Severity 1:** Immediate escalation (within 1 hour)
- **Severity 2:** Within 2 hours
- **Severity 3:** Next business day
- **Severity 4:** Logged, scheduled investigation

---

## Incident Response Procedure

### Phase 1: Detect & Alert (0–15 Minutes)

**Detection Methods:**
- Automated alerts (SIEM, IDS, monitoring)
- Staff report (customer, employee, system)
- Regulatory notification (law enforcement, regulator)
- Third-party notification (vendor, partner)

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Report:** Alert reaches on-call incident commander
2. **Verify:** Confirm incident is real (not false alarm)
3. **Classify:** Assign severity level (1–4)
4. **Notify:** Escalate per escalation matrix ([[escalation_matrix]])
5. **Activate:** Convene incident response team

**Notification Timeline:**
- **Severity 1:** Executive team (ASAP), Board (within 2 hours)
- **Severity 2:** Executive team (within 30 min), CRO (within 1 hour)
- **Severity 3:** Department head (within 4 hours)
- **Severity 4:** Log incident (routine)

---

### Phase 2: Containment (15–60 Minutes)

**Objectives:**
- Stop attack/prevent spread
- Preserve evidence
- Protect unaffected systems
- Maintain business continuity

**Containment Actions:**

**For Cyberattack (Malware/Ransomware):**
- Isolate affected system (disconnect from network)
- Prevent further access (reset credentials, block IP)
- Preserve logs/evidence (copy before shutdown)
- Kill processes (if possible without data loss)

**For Data Breach:**
- Identify compromised data (scope)
- Contain access (revoke credentials)
- Monitor for misuse (credit monitoring if PII)
- Preserve evidence (logs, audit trail)

**For System Outage:**
- Failover to backup (if available)
- Isolate failed component
- Prevent escalation
- Begin restoration

**For Fraud:**
- Freeze compromised account
- Block fraudulent transactions
- Prevent further unauthorized access
- Collect evidence

---

### Phase 3: Investigation (1–24 Hours)

**Investigative Steps:**
1. **Timeline:** When did incident start? How was it detected?
2. **Scope:** How many systems/customers affected?
3. **Root Cause:** How did it happen? Why?
4. **Data:** What data was accessed/exfiltrated?
5. **Threat:** Who did this? External or internal?
6. **Evidence:** Collect logs, memory dumps, disk images

**Investigation Tools:**
- Forensic tools (EnCase, FTK)
- Log analysis (splunk, ELK)
- Network analysis (packet capture, network flows)
- Endpoint analysis (EDR telemetry)

**Evidence Preservation:**
- Chain of custody maintained
- Logs collected and protected
- System snapshots taken
- Timeline established

---

### Phase 4: Recovery & Restoration (1–48 Hours)

**Recovery Actions:**

**System Recovery:**
1. **Backup Restore:** Restore from clean backup
2. **Patch:** Apply security patches
3. **Rebuild:** Rebuild from clean media (if needed)
4. **Test:** Verify functionality, no malware
5. **Monitor:** Watch for re-infection

**Data Recovery:**
1. **Identify:** What data needs recovery
2. **Restore:** Restore from backup
3. **Validate:** Verify data integrity
4. **Communicate:** Notify customers (if breach)

**Service Restoration:**
1. **Phased:** Restore critical services first
2. **Verify:** Test before full restoration
3. **Capacity:** Ensure systems handle normal load
4. **Monitoring:** Enhanced monitoring post-incident

---

- Lessons learned discussed

**Review Topics:**
1. **What Happened?** Incident summary
2. **Why Did It Happen?** Root cause (technical and process)
3. **What Did We Do Right?** Acknowledgment of good decisions
4. **What Could We Improve?** Process/technical gaps
5. **What's Our Fix?** Preventive and corrective actions

**Outcomes:**
