## Purpose

Define how FirstUK selects the controlling document when guidance overlaps,
changes over time, or disagrees.

## Authority Order

For the same subject, apply the highest applicable authority first:

1. Applicable law, regulator direction, and regulatory circular requirements
2. Board-approved policy and risk appetite statements
3. Approved standard operating procedures
4. Approved operational guides and training manuals
5. Approved customer communications and templates
6. Reference material, FAQs, and descriptive system documentation

A lower-authority document may explain how to carry out a requirement, but may
not weaken a higher-authority requirement. An explicit supersession controls
from its effective date.

## Status Vocabulary

| Status | Meaning | Permitted Use |
|---|---|---|
| Draft | Not approved for operational use | Context only; do not rely on it for a decision |
| Active | Approved and currently effective | Apply if it governs the question date |
| Superseded | Replaced by a named later document | Use only for historical questions before replacement |
| Withdrawn | No longer valid and not replaced | Do not use as operating guidance |

## Decision Rules

1. Establish the decision or event date.
2. Identify documents in force on that date.
3. Apply explicit supersession before a general version-number comparison.
4. Apply the authority order when active documents overlap.
5. If active sources of equal authority disagree and no resolution is recorded,
   identify and attribute the conflict; escalate rather than invent a rule.
6. Record the documents considered and the basis for the decision.

## Examples

- `[[policy_customer_identification_v2]]` controls KYC decisions from
  2026-03-01 and supersedes `[[policy_customer_identification]]`.
- `[[sop_account_opening_v3]]` implements that policy change; it does not replace
  the policy as the governing requirement.
- `[[interest_rate_schedule_2026_03]]` controls SmartSaver rates from its stated
  effective date; earlier schedules remain historical evidence.
