## Step 3: System Setup

## Step 5: Standing Order Execution

### Scheduled Processing

**Timing:**

- Processing occurs early morning (before business hours)
- Funds transferred via FPS (Faster Payments Service)
- Recipient account receives funds within 1 hour

**Execution Process:**
1. System identifies standing orders due
2. Validates source account has sufficient funds
3. Initiates FPS transfer
4. Records transaction in ledger
5. Updates standing order status (completed)
6. Notifies customer (optional, if opted in)

**If Funds Unavailable:**
- Transfer fails (declined)
- Customer notified of failure
- Retry attempt made (usually once)
- Manual intervention if persistent failure

---

## Step 6: Modify Standing Order

### Changes Allowed

Customer can modify:
- ✅ **Amount:** Change payment amount (creates new SO, cancels old)
- ✅ **Frequency:** Change timing (weekly → monthly, etc.)
- ✅ **Payee:** Change recipient (creates new SO, cancels old)
- ✅ **End Date:** Set or change end date

### Modification Process

**Online Modification:**
1. Customer logs into online banking
2. Selects standing order to modify
3. Changes desired field(s)
4. Confirms modification
5. Receives confirmation

**Branch/Phone Modification:**
1. Customer calls or visits branch
2. Provides standing order ID and current details
3. Specifies changes requested
4. Staff member updates system
5. Sends confirmation to customer

**Note:** Full changes (amount, payee, frequency) may require cancellation of old SO and creation of new SO

---

## Step 7: Cancel Standing Order

### Cancellation Request

**How to Request:**
- Online: Self-service cancellation in portal

- Branch: Visit and request cancellation
- Mail: Send written cancellation request

**Information Needed:**

### Cancellation Process

**Steps:**
1. Customer requests cancellation
2. Staff verifies customer identity
3. Confirms standing order to cancel
4. Sets status to "Cancelled"
5. Effective date: Immediately (no notice period)
6. Next scheduled payment blocked
7. Confirmation sent to customer

**Timeline:** Cancellation effective immediately  
**No Fees:** Cancellation is free  
**No Notice Required:** Customer can cancel anytime with no notice

### Cancellation Confirmation

**Customer Receives:**
- Email confirmation of cancellation
- Standing order ID that was canceled
- Date of cancellation
- Confirmation that no further payments will be made

---

## Step 8: Failed Standing Orders

### Failure Scenarios

**Common Failure Reasons:**
- Insufficient funds in source account
- Invalid recipient account number
- Recipient account closed
- Payee bank system failure
- Duplicate prevention (if failed before)

### Failure Handling

**Step 1: Detect Failure**
- System logs failed standing order attempt
- Marks standing order status as "Failed"

**Step 2: Alert Customer**
- Email/SMS sent to customer
- Alert includes: Amount, recipient, failure reason
- Request for action (provide funds, update payee)

**Step 3: Retry Attempt**
- System retries once (usually within 24 hours)
- If retry successful: Standing order resumes

**Step 4: Escalation**
- If retry fails: Standing order suspended
- Staff review required
- Contact customer to resolve

**Step 5: Resolution**
- Customer provides corrected information (if needed)
- Staff updates standing order
- Standing order resumes or customer opts for cancellation

---

## Monitoring & Control

### Weekly Standing Order Review

**Operations Staff Reviews:**
- Total value of standing orders executed
- Number of failed standing orders
- Unusual patterns (large amounts, unusual recipients)
- Customer complaints related to standing orders

**Reconciliation:**
- Standing order transactions match customer expectations
- No duplicate payments
- All executed on scheduled dates

### Audit Trail

**System Records:**
- All standing orders (active and canceled)
- Creation date and staff who created
- All modifications and cancellations
