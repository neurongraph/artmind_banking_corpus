## Purpose

Establish procedures for identifying, investigating, and resolving operational exceptions (failed transactions, disputed transactions, regulatory exceptions) to ensure customer satisfaction and regulatory compliance.

---

## Scope

Applies to:
- Failed transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers)
- Disputed transactions (customer claims unauthorized)
- Regulatory exceptions (compliance failures, audit issues)
- Exception escalation and resolution

---

## Exception Categories

### Category 1: Transaction Failures

**Definition:** Transaction initiated but not completed successfully

**Examples:**
- Bank transfer fails (recipient account invalid)
- ATM withdrawal denied (insufficient funds)
- Standing order fails (account closed)
- Direct Debit rejected (no funds)

**Customer Impact:** High (customer expecting transaction to complete)  
**SLA:** Resolve within 1–3 business days

---

### Category 2: Disputed Transactions

**Definition:** Customer claims transaction unauthorized or incorrect

**Examples:**
- "I didn't authorize this transfer"
- "I was charged twice"
- "Amount is wrong (£50 instead of £5)"
- "Transaction shows wrong date"

**Customer Impact:** High (financial loss claim)  
**SLA:** Investigate within 5–10 business days

---

### Category 3: Regulatory Exceptions

**Definition:** Operational or compliance issue flagged by audit/risk

**Examples:**
- Missing KYC documentation
- AML screening delay
- Transaction outside policy limits
- Regulatory reporting error

**Customer Impact:** Low (internal issue, may require account restriction)  
**SLA:** Remediate within 5–30 days (depends on severity)

---

## Exception Detection

### Automated Detection

**System Monitors For:**
- Failed transaction attempts (system logs)
- Unusual transaction patterns (fraud rules)
- Regulatory alerts (compliance flagged)
- KYC/AML exceptions (verification issues)

**Action:** Automatic logging to exception queue

### Manual Detection

**Staff Reports:**
- Customer complaint (phone, email, branch)
- Teller observation (transaction rejected)
- Audit finding (control testing)
- Regulator communication (regulatory exception)

**Action:** Logged by staff, escalated to exception team

---

## Step 1: Triage & Categorization

### Receipt

When exception reported:
1. **Log Immediately**
   - Exception ID generated (EXC-00001234)
   - Date/time recorded
   - Reporter name noted
   - Initial description captured

2. **Categorize**
   - Is it a failed transaction? → Category 1
   - Is it a customer dispute? → Category 2
   - Is it regulatory? → Category 3

3. **Assess Severity**
   - Amount involved
   - Customer impact
   - Regulatory implication
   - Escalation required?

---

## Step 2: Investigation

### Category 1: Failed Transactions

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Pull transaction record from system
2. Check status (why did it fail?)
3. Verify customer authorization
4. Confirm account details correct
5. Assess if reversible

**Common Failure Reasons & Resolution:**

| Reason | Investigation | Resolution |
|--------|---|---|
| Insufficient funds | Confirm balance at time of attempt | Explain to customer, offer retry once funds available |
| Invalid recipient | Check account number format | Contact customer for correct details, retry |
| Account frozen | Confirm freeze in place and reason | Unfreeze if valid, notify customer |
| Duplicate prevention | Check for earlier same transaction | Explain duplicate rule, offer manual retry |

**Outcome:** Refund if funds were debited + failed, retry if appropriate, or explain to customer

### Category 2: Disputed Transactions

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Pull transaction details
2. Verify customer authorized
3. Check timestamp and amount
4. Review customer history (patterns?)
5. Assess fraud likelihood

**Questions to Answer:**
- Did customer authorize this amount?
- To whom was money sent? (known party?)
- Was customer negligent? (shared password?)
- Timeline: When reported vs. when occurred?

**Outcomes:**
- **Unauthorized:** Full refund within 10 days
- **Authorized:** Explain, educate customer
- **Disputed:** Further investigation or escalation

### Category 3: Regulatory Exceptions

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Identify specific regulatory issue
2. Assess impact (customer-facing vs. internal)
3. Determine remediation steps
4. Check if other customers affected
5. Document for audit trail

**Examples & Remediation:**

| Exception | Issue | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Missing KYC | Account opened without ID verification | Obtain missing docs immediately, suspend if can't provide |
| AML delay | Customer screened 3 days after opening | Retroactive screening, escalate if flagged |
| Rate error | Wrong interest applied to account | Recalculate, add back-interest if in customer's favor |
